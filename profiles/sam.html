            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Sam Stålhandske and I'm someone who's very passionate about art and creativity.
                In my spare time, I work on whatever I'm interested in at the time; emulators, operating systems, programming langugages, games etc.
                I also create/produce music alone and together with a group of musicians, mostly hip-hop.
                September 2024 I moved, together with my girlfriend and our four pets, to a house in Skurup. 
            </p>

            <h2>Experiences</h2>
            <h3>2015-2018: Ljud och Bildskolan, Helsingborg. Game Development</h3>
            <p>
                Here, in addition to a regular technical high school education, I formally learned the basics of programming with a focus on games.
                Before this, I had on my own tried modifying games I liked, for example by adding new items in Minecraft.
                We wrote a lot of C# and Lua (LÖVE). I also participated in several game jams both inside and outside of school. It was here that my teacher encouraged me to take the next step ...
            </p>
            <h3>2018-2020: The Game Assembly, Malmö. Game Programmer</h3>
            <p>
                I moved into my first apartment in the summer of 2018. At this vocational university, I learned to write games and game engines in C++.
                After a few intense years, it was time for an internship. Two classmates and I each got a spot at Thunderful Games’ newly opened office in Malmö.
            </p>
            <h3>2020-2025: Thunderful Games, Malmö. Game Programmer</h3>
            <p>
                Here I worked on two different game projects together with several teams across Sweden.
                Unfortunately, neither of these projects has been released yet, but it was a very educational journey.
                Sadly, I and large parts of the company were laid off, so it was time for me to look for new opportunities and/or broaden my skill set ...
            </p>
            <h3>2025-2027: Chas Academy, Malmö. Software Developer</h3>
            <p>
                Now I hope to broaden my skills so that I can become a well-rounded programmer capable of working in different types of industries.
                Here I want to learn more about C and C++ and work on "real"/physical projects. I’m planning to get an Arduino and experiment with it.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Chas Academy?</h2>
            <p>
                It seems like a serious program where I can hopefully learn more about programming real things and making a positive impact on the world, but also get to know and build relationships with others.
